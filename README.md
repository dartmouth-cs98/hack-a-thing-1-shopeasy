#### Description
ShopEasy is an attempt at creating an e-Commerce Android App using Android Studio (I used Java for the back-end). In this first hack, I focused on the selling part of the app where sellers can upload products with images.

#### What worked
Users can choose product categories and upload images from their camera roll. Images and product details are successfully stored to the database (Firebase).

#### What did not work
I wanted to fetch images from the database and display them for buyers but I have not been able to do so yet.
